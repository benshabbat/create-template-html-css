# Shared Template Resources

This directory contains shared resources used across multiple templates:

## Files

### base.css
Common CSS reset and base styles used by all templates:
- CSS Reset (margin, padding, box-sizing)
- Base body styles with gradient background
- Common font family

## Usage

Templates can import these shared resources to avoid code duplication.
However, for this package, each template is kept self-contained for easier copy-paste usage.

These files serve as documentation and future optimization reference.
